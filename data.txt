Why do we need Callbacks?

For one very important reason â€” JavaScript is an event driven language. This means that instead of waiting for a response before moving on, JavaScript will keep executing while listening for other events. Lets look at a basic example:

function first(){
  console.log(1);
}function second(){
  console.log(2);
}first();
second();
